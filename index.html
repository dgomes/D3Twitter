                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>How do I try this?</b><p>Go to your address bar and fill in the status id of the tweet you want to visualize.</p>
			<p><b>Walk through:</b></p>
                        <p>Open the tweet you want to visualize, and copy the large number</p>
                        <img src="images/howto1.jpg" alt="twitter.com address bar containing status number">
                        <p>Go to http://d3-twitter.appspot.com/, and paste the number at the end of the url</p>
                        <img src="images/howto2.jpg" alt="status bar of d3-tweeter">
                        <p>that's it!</p>
                    </li>
		<li><b>Can I embed this application on my website?</b><p>Sure you can! just place this line of code with the correct status id:<code>		&lt;iframe src="http://d3-twitter.appspot.com/231546862459551745" width=670px height=560px frameborder=0&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></p></li>
		    <li><b>Whats with all the white space, on where the example should be?</b><p>Sorry, it seems you might be running an old browser version. Please update your web browser.</p></li>
                    <li><b>How was this accomplished?</b><p>This demo makes use of <a href='http://d3js.org'>d3js</a>, <a href='https://developers.google.com/appengine/'>google app engine (GAE)</a> and <a href='https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/'>tweepy</a>. Oh! and of course Python.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Why aren't all circles equal?</b><p>One of the circle's represents the author of the status message (the one in dark blue), then each circle has a dimension proportional to the number of followers (capped at 400 followers).</p></li>
                    <li><b>Why are some circles disconnected?</b><p>The most likely reason is that a protected user (who likes to keep it's privacy) retweeted the status therefore breaking the graph.</p></li>
		    <li><b>Now, why would you want to do this?</b><p>Here's the thing, I wanted to test drive GAE with Python and needed to come up with a simple application. Just a few days before one of my tweets started being retweeted by a bunch of folks I never met, so I googled for a tool to visualize the connection between those folks and saw nothing that good enough (hereby imply that flash is not OK). So I guessed it was worth reinventing the wheel!</p></li>
                    <li><b>Why is twitter asking for permission?</b><p>The app will use your twitter account to request information from twitter on the users who have retweeted the status you requested. The authorization is valid <em>only</em> for a single status check, although the status results will be cached for the next user who uses the app to get the visualization of the same status.</p></li>
                    <li><b>After using your service, my &lt;insert twitter application&gt; is not working anymore, have you hacked my account?</b><p><em>D3 Twitter</em> does not keep your user nor password in anyway, it uses the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/oauth/faq">OAuth protocol</a> to request Twitter permission to use the API on your behalf. That said, twitter has a rate limit on the number of calls one can make at it's API (<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/faq">see here)</a>. Due it's nature, <em>D3 Twitter</em> might issue an unusual number of API calls to twitter eventually reaching the said limit. When that happens, twitter will not enable <em>any</em> application to issue calls to it's API for a limited period of time (usually few minutes). So in case that happened to you, don't panic! Your application will be back in a couple of minutes, and sorry for that :)</p></li>
		    <li><b>Who wrote this service?</b><p>That would be <a href=http://www.diogogomes.com>me.</a><p></li>
		<li><b>Is this site affiliated to Twitter?</b><p>By no means.</p></li>
		   <li><b>Why the name <em>D3 Twitter</em>?</b><p>It's a word play with D3js and Twitter, just that nothing else.</p></li>
	 	   <li><b>Do you plan on open sourcing it?</b><p>Probably, but you can always ask me for the code (<a href="http://twitter.com/dgomes">@dgomes</a>)</p></li>
		   <li><b>What's with the extended FAQ?</b><p>You are putting in the questions, I'm just answering them. Still have questions? contact me</p></li>
